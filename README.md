# gmmreg-python
Python implementation of "Robust Point Set Registration Using Gaussian Mixture Models" by Jian &amp; Vemuri, PAMI'11.


Please note that we have another [github repo](https://github.com/bing-jian/gmmreg) that contains C++ implementation and 
more info about this work.

### Build and Test
Run the following steps to download, install and test the gmmreg python package:
  ```Shell
  git clone https://github.com/bing-jian/gmmreg-python.git
  cd gmmreg-python
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  cd src
  python setup.py install --user
  cd ../data
  python ../demo.py ./fish_partial.ini
  ```
If the gmmreg package was successfully installed, the last command should give a point set matching result like the image below:
